    <em>This is a very limited help for the initial release of the database system, contact <a href="mailto:panton@gfy.ku.dk">panton@gfy.ku.dk</a> if this manual does not solve your problem</em>


    <h2>How the data is organized</h2>

    <h3>Dataset</h3>

    <p>As datasets can have different properties, depending on how the data itself is organized, the database can be extended to support these.
    But for now, only one class of datasets are supported: <em>sequence</em>.</p>

    <p>A sequence is data that fits into a single worksheet in Excel or can be represented as numbers in classic text file.
    Sequence data typically come in the form of tabular data. 
    The first column of the sequence is called the index. 
    For ice core data the index is typically depth, or in CFA the index could be a number of seconds.</p>


    <h3>Study</h3>

    <p>Related <em>datasets</em> are organized into <em>studies</em>. 
    The study is the building block of the database.</p>

    <p>A study can be <em>stand-alone</em> or it can be part of the activity/project hierarchy. 
    A study can even be part of multiple activties, such as an intercomparison between multiple ice cores.</p>

    <p>The study defines access to data. Only groups which are permitted to can access the study.</p>




    <h3>Activities and Projects</h3>

    <p>The activities and projects are used to browse data. 
    It is a simple way to reference studies to a specific activity that has taken place.</p>

    <p>Examples of activities: ice coring, measuring aerosols, temperature profiles in firn, weather stations</p>

    <p>The project is a level above the activity, it defines which project the activities were a part of. Examples: NEEM, GRIP, EPICA</p>
